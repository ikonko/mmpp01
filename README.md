Manic Miner for PP-01 (SinDiKat version)


This is the code derived from https://skoolkid.gitlab.io/manicminer/ and an attempt to convert it for Czechoslovakian computer of 1980's called ZVT PP-01.

Similar project exists in a binary form and supports only B/W graphics. This was coded by OldComp.cz user Stamil and is available https://www.oldcomp.cz/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=7515

The current version of this particular port is not finished yet, but it's goal is to make the game more playable, enjoyable and colourful.
