Manic Miner for PP-01 (SinDiKat version)


This code is derived from https://skoolkid.gitlab.io/manicminer/ and the project goal is to convert it to Czechoslovakian computer of 1980's called ZVT PP-01. Basic specs of this computer: Intel 8080 derivate (Tesla MHB 8080) at 2MHz CPU clock, 64kB of RAM, 16k of ROM with GBASIC, graphics is 256x256 pixels in 8 colors - every pixel has its own color.

Similar project exists in a binary form and supports only B/W graphics. This was coded by OldComp.cz user Stamil and is available https://www.oldcomp.cz/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=7515

The current version of this particular port is not finished yet, but it's ultimate goal is to make the game more playable, enjoyable and colorful.
